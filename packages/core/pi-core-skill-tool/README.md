## Install

Requires the [pi coding agent](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) — install it first: `npm install -g @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`.

```sh
pi install npm:@lukisxyz/pi-core-skill-tool
```

Pi extension that implements **opencode2-style skills**: the skill catalog is stripped from the system prompt and exposed through a single lazy `skill` tool.

## Why

Pi injects the full `<available_skills>` catalog (name + description for every skill) into the system prompt — **~7.2K tokens every session, whether you use skills or not**. opencode2 instead packs the catalog into one tool's description and loads skill bodies only when the agent calls the tool.

This extension does the same for pi.

## How it works

1. `before_agent_start` → reads the skill catalog from `event.systemPromptOptions.skills` (pi's own discovery — project, user, settings, CLI, and npm package skills) and strips the built-in `<available_skills>...</available_skills>` block from the system prompt
2. Registers one lazy `skill` tool; its description carries a compact catalog (name + truncated description, 100 chars/skill)
3. Agent matches a task → calls `skill("name")` → the tool reads that skill's SKILL.md body on demand and returns it → agent follows instructions

No filesystem discovery: the catalog comes entirely from pi via `systemPromptOptions` on `before_agent_start`, so it always matches what pi itself loads — no re-scanning, no divergence. SKILL.md bodies are read lazily only when the tool is called, saving ~4.5K tokens/session.

## Compatibility

- **pi >= 0.99 (structured prompts):** the `skills` entry (and any custom `skills` section) is removed from `systemPromptOptions`, so pi keeps its per-section prompt updates and the extension never forces the whole prompt.
- **Older pi (prebuilt prompt string):** the rendered `<available_skills>` catalog is stripped from the returned prompt (handles both `read` and `bash` wording), while pi's shared discovered-skill list stays intact so `/skill:name` keeps working.
- If the catalog cannot be located, the prompt is left unchanged and a warning is logged.

### Row by row

**Baseline (nothing)** — stock pi, no extension, no flags.

- Context: **26,480 tokens** every session.
- The full catalog (all 69 skills, name + description + file path ≈ 28.9K chars) is embedded in the system prompt.
- The agent sees every skill listed and can `read` any SKILL.md it wants — skills are fully agent-invocable.
- Cost: the catalog is paid upfront whether or not any skill is ever used.

**Ext ON (strip + tool)** — this extension installed, default mode.

- Context: **22,021 tokens** (-4,459 vs baseline).
- The catalog is removed from the system prompt and instead lives inside the description of one `skill` tool (truncated to 100 chars/skill ≈ 11.7K chars).
- The agent still auto-invokes skills — it matches a task against the tool's catalog, calls `skill("name")`, and receives the full SKILL.md content. No user input.
- `/skill:name` still works (pi's command system is independent of the prompt catalog).

**Ext OFF + flag ON** — extension removed, `disable-model-invocation: true` added to every SKILL.md frontmatter.

- Context: **18,660 tokens** — the cheapest, but at a hard cost.
- The flag hides skills from the system prompt entirely, so the agent **cannot see or load them**.
- Only the user can trigger a skill by typing `/skill:name`.
- Verified: asked about a private skill, the agent could not load it and improvised by reading unrelated source files instead.

### The tradeoff in one line

The 3.4K tokens between Ext ON and Ext OFF+flag is the price of **agent-side skill invocation**. Ext OFF+flag saves the most but makes skills user-only — the agent's ability to use skills is gone. Ext ON keeps skills fully agent-invocable for a fraction of the baseline cost.

## Our case — measured on this machine

Reference environment (the numbers above come from it):

- **Model**: `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash` (deepseek tokenizer)
- **Skills loaded**: 69 (historical measurement; included third-party npm-shipped skills)
- **Tool count**: 25 baseline → 26 with the extension (the extra one is `skill`)

Context composition at baseline (26,480 total):

| Component | Tokens | Share |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 25 tool definitions (schemas + descriptions) | ~16K | 60% |
| System prompt text (instructions, guidelines) | ~10.5K | 40% |
| — of which: skill catalog (`<available_skills>`) | ~7.2K | 27% |

Context excluding skills ≈ **19.3K** in that historical measurement; current context depends on the installed extensions.

What the extension changes:

| | Baseline | Ext ON | Δ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Skill catalog in system prompt | 28.9K chars | stripped (0) | -28.9K |
| Catalog in `skill` tool description | — | 11.7K chars | +11.7K |
| Net catalog cost | 7.2K tok | 2.9K tok | **-4.3K** |
| Total fresh context | 26,480 | 22,021 | **-4,459** |

## Pros

- **Saves ~4.5K tokens/session (measured)** — 17% of fresh context, every session, no behavior change
- **Agent keeps full skill autonomy** — same invocation flow as baseline, no user input required
- **Lazy by design** — skill bodies load only when the tool is called, exactly like opencode2
- **Zero config** — discovers the same skill locations pi uses, dedupes symlinks
- **Reversible** — uninstall to go back to baseline; no skill files are modified
- **Kill switch** — `PI_SKILL_TOOL=0` disables the tool (strip-only, ~19K) for emergency savings

## Cons

- **Truncated descriptions** (100 chars) — the agent matches on keywords rather than full text. Skill bodies are complete when loaded; only the catalog summary is shortened
- **Catalog still costs ~2.9K** — the tool description must carry skill names for the agent to discover them. Removing it entirely (Ext OFF+flag) is cheaper but kills agent invocation
